1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ans=The values are True and False .
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ans=AND,OR ,NOT>
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ans= True and True is True.

True and False is False.

False and True is False.

False and False is False.

True or True is True.

True or False is True.

False or True is True.

False or False is False.

not True is False.

not False is True.


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
 
ans:(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) =False
   not (5 > 4) = False
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True
   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False
   (True and True) and (True == False) = False
   (not False) or (not True) == True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

ans:
Python has six comparison operators: less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ), equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one

ans:The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

ans:block1
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
block2
    if spam > 5:
    print('bacon') 
block3
     else:
    print('ham') 
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

Q8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

ans=
spam = int(input("Input a no."))
if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")


Q9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?

Ans . If program is stuck in endless loop we will press ctrl+c i.e interrupt the kernel.

Q10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

ans=# use of break
for i in range(10):
    if(i==7):
        break
    print(i)
    
print('Breaked')
#use of  continue
for i in range(10):
    if(i==7):
        continue
    print(i)

conclusion:
The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. The continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.


Q11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans=
for i in range(10):
    
    print(i)
for i in range(10):
    
    print(i)
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
for i in range (0,10):
for i in range (0,10):
    print(i)
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
i
for i in range (0,10 ,1):
    print(i)
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
  

conclusion:
here the output are same but range(10) calls  ranges from 0 to 10 but 10 in not included ,range(0,10)  means 0 is the starting point
and go till 10 here also 10 is not included and range(0,10,1) it means start from 0 go till 10 with the difference of 1 wher 10 is not included.



Q12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
ans=
   print("for loop")
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
a=1
print(" for while loop ")
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a=a+1
    

for loop
